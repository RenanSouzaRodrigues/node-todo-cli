# Node Todo Cli

This app is very basic and just need the following to work:
```
npm install (or whatever you're using)

npm link
```

Probably there other packages that do the same but none fits my needs.
This app is very simple. If you need something more complex, just fork it and go nuts. =)
(Code quality is garbage by the way.)
