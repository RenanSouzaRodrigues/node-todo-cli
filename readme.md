# Node Todo Cli

This app is very basic and just need the following to work:
- create a file at the root folder of the application with the name: `database.json`;
- put the following content inside:
```
{ "tasks": [] }
```
- Run the following commands:

```
npm install (or whatever you're using)

npm link
```

Probably there other packages that do the same but none fits my needs.
This app is very simple. If you need something more complex, just fork it and go nuts. =)
(Code quality is garbage by the way.)
